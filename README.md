## Overview

From the website of China's largest second-hand housing transaction agency platform (https://xa.lianjia.com/chengjiao/), I used crawler technology, combined with  many relevant cases on Github and CSDN community, and finally realized the purpose of getting Lianjia's transaction records in Xi'an.

In addition, I also used the API interface of Baidu map. By searching the name of the neighborhood where the second-hand houses are located through API interface of Baidu map, I obtained the longitude and latitude information of the second-hand houses in each transaction record.

## Legal Notice

To avoid legal risk, the project complies with the Lianjia's Robot.txt protocol. Only the public information in the "content" directory was obtained, and the crawl interval was set to avoid affecting the server, without triggering the anti-crawler system. And the acquired data is only used for learning.
